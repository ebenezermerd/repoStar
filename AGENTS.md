## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository (`repoStar`) is currently empty — it contains only a `README.md` placeholder. No application code, dependencies, build system, or services have been added yet.

- **No package manager or dependency manifest** exists (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
- **No lint, test, or build commands** are configured.
- **No services** need to be started.

Once application code is added, update this section with:
- How to install dependencies
- How to run lint/test/build
- How to start development servers
- Any non-obvious caveats discovered during setup
